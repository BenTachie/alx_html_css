# 🎨 Smileschool: Advanced CSS Styling Project

## 📘 Project Overview

This project is a continuation of the *HTML, Advanced* module, with a focus on applying modern, standards-compliant **CSS styling** to structure, beautify, and enhance the responsiveness of a multipage layout. The layout and visual design are based on a Figma prototype, simulating a real-world front-end development workflow.

You will work strictly with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**, without relying on any frameworks or libraries, to sharpen your core frontend skills.

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to clearly explain:

- ✅ What CSS is and its role in web development
- ✅ How to apply inline, internal, and external styles to elements
- ✅ The concept and utility of CSS **classes**
- ✅ How CSS **selectors** work and how to write efficient ones
- ✅ How to compute **CSS specificity values**
- ✅ The **Box Model** and how it affects element layout
- ✅ How a browser loads and renders a webpage (from parsing to painting)

```
## 🚫 Constraints

❌ No use of external libraries or frameworks (e.g., Bootstrap, React, Vue)

❌ No use of Node.js or NPM

✅ Code must pass W3C validation for both HTML and CSS

✅ All files must end with a newline character

✅ Styling must be non-positioning unless within the <article> tag (per scope constraints)

## 🎨 Styling Guidelines
Recreate the design from the provided Figma file with high visual accuracy

Follow mobile-first, responsive design principles

Use semantic HTML5 elements

Apply Flexbox for layout where needed

Integrate custom fonts like Source Sans Pro and Spin Cycle OT (if not installed, download manually)

Use icons via Font Awesome (already linked via CDN)

## 🌍 Responsive Design
Ensure your site is usable and aesthetically pleasing across different screen sizes. Pay attention to:

Font scaling

Layout adaptability (stacking, wrapping)

Image responsiveness

Mobile viewport configuration (<meta name="viewport" ...>)

## 🖼️ Image Resources
Images provided in the downloadable ZIP must be placed in an /images folder and referenced properly within the HTML.

## 💡 Notes
Values from Figma may be floats—feel free to round them to the nearest practical unit (e.g., 12.3px → 12px).

Update the HTML content (e.g., logos, icons) to match the final design.

You may customize content within the <article> tag but must not alter the Flexbox-based layout strategy outside it.
