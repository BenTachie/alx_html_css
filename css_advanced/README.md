# 🎨 Smileschool: Advanced CSS Styling Project

## 📘 Project Overview

This project is a continuation of the *HTML, Advanced* module, with a focus on applying modern, standards-compliant **CSS styling** to structure, beautify, and enhance the responsiveness of a multipage layout. The layout and visual design are based on a Figma prototype, simulating a real-world front-end development workflow.

You will work strictly with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**, without relying on any frameworks or libraries, to sharpen your core frontend skills.

└── README.md             # Project documentation

```
## 🚫 Constraints

❌ No use of external libraries or frameworks (e.g., Bootstrap, React, Vue)

❌ No use of Node.js or NPM

✅ Code must pass W3C validation for both HTML and CSS

✅ All files must end with a newline character

✅ Styling must be non-positioning unless within the <article> tag (per scope constraints)

## 📌 Styling Guidelines

- Recreate the design from the **provided Figma file** with high visual fidelity.
- Follow **mobile-first** and **responsive design** principles.
- Use **semantic HTML5** elements for structure and accessibility.
- Apply **Flexbox** for layout wherever applicable.
- Integrate custom fonts:
  - `Source Sans Pro`
  - `Spin Cycle OT`  
  *(If not pre-installed, download and include manually in the project.)*
- Use **Font Awesome** for icons (already linked via CDN).

## 🌍 Responsive Design

Ensure your site is **usable and visually appealing** across different screen sizes. Pay close attention to:

- 📏 Font scaling
- 🧱 Layout adaptability (stacking, wrapping, reordering)
- 🖼️ Image responsiveness
- 📱 Mobile viewport configuration  
```
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
 ```
  
## 🖼️ Image Resources

All images provided in the downloadable ZIP file should be placed in an /images folder.

Reference them correctly in your HTML using relative paths:
```
<img src="./images/filename.png" alt="description">
```

## 💡 Additional Notes: 

- Values from Figma may appear as floating-point units (e.g., 12.3px).
👉 You may round to the nearest practical value (e.g., 12px).
- Ensure the HTML content such as logos, icons, and copy matches the final design.
- You are allowed to customise the content within the <article> tag.
- Do not alter the Flexbox-based layout strategy outside of the <article> structure.
